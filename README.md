Library Management System
This is a simple application for managing a collection of books. The program is split into two Python files: book.py, which defines the Book class, and library_manager.py, which contains the main program logic.

Features
Add Books: Users can input the title, author, and ISBN of a new book to add it to the library.

List All Books: Displays a formatted list of all books currently in the library.

Find a Book: Allows users to search for a book using either the title or author.

Modular Design: The program uses a Book class to encapsulate book data. This encourages code reusability and organization.

How to Run
You must have both book.py and library_manager.py in the same directory.

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where the files are located.

Run the program using the following command: Run

python library_manager.py
File Structure
book.py: Defines the Book class with attributes for title, author, and ISBN, along with methods for retrieving book details.

library_manager.py: The main script that imports the Book class and contains functions to add, list, and search books.
